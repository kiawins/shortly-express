#shortly-express
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). 

Shortly-Express is a link-shortening service which uses a Node.js powered Express server to serve static files, shorten and store links, and a route handler to send users to the correctly shortened URL.
